PART 1:
1) Create a layout on a piece of paper / done
2) Create configuration panel layout / done
3) Create a maze layout including cells / done
4) Add legend for the maze / done
5) Add game state text / done
6) Add a separate node component / done
7) Final layout review, change if needed / done


PART 2:

1) Take a look at some existing projects on github
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msttfIHHkak&ab_channel=Cl%C3%A9mentMihailescu / done
https://github.com/clementmihailescu/Pathfinding-Visualizer-Tutorial / done

2) Consider the position of different components and states / done
3) Write a plan for further tasks in details, including the flow of each func

States:
The main component should hold all states. States that need to be held:
1) Object: {Maze nodes (populated to empty nodes by default), 'start', 'finish'}
Node properties: visited, available_pathways
2) Game states ('Waiting for generation', 'Generation in progress', 'Ready to start',
'Game in progress', 'Solving in progress', 'Game finished')
3) Algorithms settings {generation_algorithm, solving_algorithm, visualization_speed}

Flow:
0) User logs in. A modal with instructions is displayed
1) 'Waiting for generation' state, "generate" button is highlighted. User clicks generate
2) 'Generation in progress' state, all buttons are disabled, visualization is in progress
3) Visualization finished, 'ready to start' state. Waiting for the user to click the start node / solve
4 a) User started, recording input. "Game in progress" state.
4 b) Solving algorithm started, visualization in progress
5) Game finished, 'game finished' state. On top, "generate" button will be available and "solve" is disabled

Couple of notes:
- Algorithms should be separated from the UI. Return a list of visited notes or whatever is needed for the UI to display the path.
And then use another func to visualize the path
- Better to store "steps" in an array because it might be needed to visualize multple steps at a time.
It will be much easier to flatten the array if it's not needed
- Check onmouthup, onmouthenter, onmouthdown when handling the user's input logic

PART 3:
1) Pass props & use them to all child components / done
2) Handle algorithms settings change / done
3) Work on first generation algorithm / done
4) Work on generation visualization / done
    4.1) Add useImmer / done
    4.2) Debug performance / done
    4.3) Performance optimizations / done
4) Cleanup everything at this point; review variable naming in recursive backtracking / done
5) Work on user's input to solve / done
6) Add controls related to game state in the control panel and maze solution / done
7) Verify that the cycle "generate > solve by user" works; refactor and cleanup / done
8) Debug the bug with the globe icon when clicking in the middle of the node / done
9) Add first solving algorithm (breadth first) // TODO tomorrow
10) Add solving visualization // TODO tomorrow
11) Handle controls related to game state when solving // TODO tomorrow
12) Add stop solving button // TODO tomorrow
13) Verify that the both cycles "generate > solve by user" and "generate > solve automatically" work // TODO tomorrow
14) Add the modal with instructions on first open // TODO Thursday
15) Add 1 more generation algorithm // TODO on weekends
16) Add generation algorithm with multiple paths in order to demonstrate shortest path in solution // TODO Monday
17) Add 1 more solution algorithm (depth first) // TODO Tuesday
17) Redesign the UI with a grid? // TODO Tuesday
18) Consider optimizations using mobx library in order to avoid re-rendering of the maze component on node change // TODO either on Wednesday or after the surgery. Most likely after the surgery


IDEAS:
 Consider adding weighted nodes in the future in order to demonstrate weighted path-finding algorithms
