NOTES:
 To deploy changes, run npm run deploy
 https://illymarev.github.io/maze-game/

IDEAS:
 Move the diameter calculation to the AWS lambda/web worker to avoid the freeze
 Do not change the maze on size change, but only after the "generate" button click
 Highlight/animate buttons to imply that they need to be clicked
 Add some animations to the maze
 Random weight generation + weighted path solving
 Add a different view option: graph
 Pause feature
 Data structures visualizer
 Maybe add Wilson's and Eller's algorithms
