PART 1:
1) Create a layout on a piece of paper / done
2) Create configuration panel layout / done
3) Create a maze layout including cells / done
4) Add legend for the maze / done
5) Add game state text / done
6) Add a separate node component / done
7) Final layout review, change if needed / done


PART 2:

1) Take a look at some existing projects on github

Couple of notes:
- Algorithms should be separated from the UI. Return a list of visited notes or whatever is needed for the UI to display the path.
And then use another func to visualize the path
- Better to store "steps" in an array because it might be needed to visualize multple steps at a time.
It will be much easier to flatten the array if it's not needed
- Check onmouthup, onmouthenter, onmouthdown when handling the user's input logic

2) Consider the position of different components and states
3) Write a plan for further tasks in details, including the flow of each func

PART 3:
TODO

IDEAS:
 Consider creating non-perfect mazes with multiple solutions in order to better demonstrate pathfinding algorithms
