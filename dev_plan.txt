v2 plan:
- Edited README // done
- Changed page title // done
- Move the maze node storage to MOBX:
1) Read the basic documentation
2) Refactor a few simple states to MOBX storage
3) Read the advanced documentation
4) Refactor the maze component & logic
5) Cleanup, refactor and optimize if needed
- Add documentation and comments
- Check the grammar and spelling
- Redesign the UI with a grid: include settings in top-right corner, and make everything scalable on large screens. Add a button to move start/end:
1) New design on paper
2) New design in code
- Settings tab
- Add the option to change grid size
- (Automatic) Option for the furthest path as a start
- Allow moving start/end when just generated

NOTES:
 To deploy changes, run npm run deploy
 https://illymarev.github.io/maze-game/

IDEAS:
 Highlight/animation to buttons to imply that they need to be clicked
 Add some animations to the maze
 Add the correct path highlight after the user solves the maze
 Add generation algorithm with multiple paths in order to demonstrate shortest path in solution
 Consider adding kruskal's and prim's algorithms
 Random weight generation + weighted path solving
 Add a different view option: graph
 Pause feature
 Data structures visualizer
