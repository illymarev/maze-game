# Maze game with algorithms visualization

https://illymarev.github.io/maze-game/

## Description

Maze game with options to visualize generation and solving algorithms, customize visualization speed, and change the
maze size and start/finish positions.

## Generating the maze

Available generation algorithms include:

- Modified Kruskal's algorithm
- Hunt And Kill algorithm
- Recursive backtracking algorithm

Once the maze is generated, start and finish can be moved by clicking
"Move start/finish" on the settings panel and dragging flags on the maze.

## Solving the maze

Mazes can be solved either manually, by clicking nodes/dragging over them, or automatically, using available solving
algorithms that include:

- Breadth-first search
- Depth-first search
